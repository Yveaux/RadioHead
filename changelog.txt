     1.47 2015-09-18 Removed top level Makefile from distribution: its only used by the developer and its presence confuses some people.  
     1.48 2015-09-30 Added support for Arduino Zero. Tested on Arduino Zero Pro. 
     1.49 2015-10-01 Fixed problems that prevented interrupts working correctly on Arduino Zero and Due. Builds and runs with 1.6.5 (with 'Arduino SAMD Boards' for Zero version 1.6.1) from arduino.cc. Arduino version 1.7.7 from arduino.org is not currently supported. 
     1.50 2015-10-25 Verified correct building and operation with Arduino 1.7.7 from arduino.org. Caution: You must burn the bootloader from 1.7.7 to the Arduino Zero before it will work with Arduino 1.7.7 from arduino.org. Conversely, you must burn the bootloader from 1.6.5 to the Arduino Zero before it will work with Arduino 1.6.5 from arduino.cc. Sigh. Fixed a problem with [RH_NRF905](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/classRH__NRF905.html "Send and receive addressed, reliable, acknowledged datagrams by nRF905 and compatible transceivers..." ) that prevented the power and frequency ranges being set properly. Reported by Alan Webber. 
     1.51 2015-12-11 Changes to RH_RF6::setTxPower() to be compatible with SX1276/77/78/79 modules that use RFO transmitter pins instead of PA_BOOST, such as the excellent Modtronix inAir4 <http://modtronix.com/inair4.html> and inAir9 modules <http://modtronix.com/inair9.html>.
